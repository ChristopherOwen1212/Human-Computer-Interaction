                Chakra ( チ ャ ク ラ chakura ) is the basic energy source needed by the ninja in the Naruto series to perform various jutsu. Ninja produces chakra through a combination of the two energies: physical energy ( 身体 エ ネ ル ー shintai enerugī ) , which is taken from trillions of cells that make up the human body, and mental energy ( 精神 エ ネ ギ ー seishin enerugī ) , obtained through experience and by training the body. [7] Once created, the chakra moves throughout the body in a manner similar to the circulatory system and is delivered to one of the 361 chakra release points. [8] By performing a sequence consisting of one of twelve different hand seals, the chakra can then be manipulated to create a supernatural effect, such as walking on water.

                    Genjutsu (幻術, Literally meaning: Illusionary Techniques) is one of the main jutsu categories which uses chakra. Unlike ninjutsu, the effects of genjutsu are not real, being only sensory illusions experienced by those who fall victim to it. According to the Second Mizukage, genjutsu falls under the broad category of Yin Release.[1]

                    The name Chidori comes from a story about famous samurai Tachibana Dōsetsu: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called Chidori (千鳥, Literally meaning: A Thousand Birds). One day, while he was still a young man, he was taking shelter under a tree, as it was raining. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the Thunder God inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to Raikiri (雷切, Literally meaning: Lightning Cutter)
